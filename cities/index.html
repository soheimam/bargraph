			<h1>The Most Expensive Cities In The World</h1>

			<p>
				Using <a href="http://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living/index">data from Expatistan</a>, this table shows the cost living index scores from most expensive to least expensive. To calculate each cities' price index, we assign a value of 100 to a central reference city (Prague) and is calculated by comparing their cost of living. If a city has a price index of 134, the living there is 34% more expensive than living in Prague.
